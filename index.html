        <h1>Welcome to my Github hub!</h1>
        <p>My name is David Powell and I make things. Usually I put more work
            into those things than I did this page, but since I'm probably the
            only person who will ever read this it didn't seem necessary. You can contact me at
            <a href="mailto:davidpowell42+ghpub@gmail.com">davidpowell42+ghpub@gmail.com</a>.</p>
        <p>Here are the projects I currently have hosted on Github:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt><a href="https://github.com/BitLooter/WebExperiments">Dave's Web Experiments</a> (<a href="http://bitlooter.github.com/WebExperiments">Homepage</a>)</dt>
            <dd>Tests and demos of various web technologies (e.g. HTML5, CSS3, etc.)</dd>
